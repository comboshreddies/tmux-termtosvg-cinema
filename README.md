# tmux-termtosvg-cinema
Replay cli terminal demo for purpose of recording vi termtosvg by using tmux

For kubectl-tks repo I wanted to have repeatable command line interface demo
I've created awk script that commands tmux what to do by reading textual file

this is early but functional version of a script

run tmux on one console, and on other run
cat demo2.ttc | ./run_demo.sh
